Machine learning is often a computation heavy exercise. To take advantage of large datasets, deep learning, and to install the best contemporary frameworks such as TensorFlow-GPU you need to have a machine with substantial GPU stats.

Fortunately, you don't have to spend thousands of dollars to buy your own machine. You can rent a Virtual Machine with the stats you need on the cloud. Virtual Machines are great to have in your tool box. Do you need a new setup or more powerful machine? No problem! 

This guide will take you through the process of setting up a Virtual Machine. In addition, we will walk though the steps required to setup the CodeSearchNet competition on your virtual machine. 

Even if you have no experience with Linux, cloud computing, or GPU drivers you will be able to easily follow this step by step guide. 

There isn't a fixed price, but I would estimate the process will cost you around $30. 

If you have $30 and a browser you are ready to go! 

# 1) Setup an account

There are many cloud computing providers available. It can be overwhelming to choose. We are going to use [Paperspace.com](https://www.paperspace.com/). They arguable have the simplest process to get your machine up and running. So lets be lazy!
